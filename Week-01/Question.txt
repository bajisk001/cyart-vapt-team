Theoretical Knowledge
1. Understanding Security Assessment
Objective: Learn how to evaluate systems without paid tools.
Explanation:
Security Assessment: Identify weaknesses using frameworks (e.g., NIST guidelines).
Types of Security Testing:
Vulnerability Assessment: Use tools like OpenVAS (open-source vulnerability scanner).
Penetration Testing: Simulate attacks with Kali Linux tools (Metasploit, Nmap).
Compliance Testing: Validate against standards using checklists (e.g., CIS Benchmarks).
2. VAPT Methodology
Objective: Follow a structured approach using methodologies.
Explanation:
Phases:
Planning: Define scope with tools like Dradis CE.
Discovery: Use Nmap (network scanning) and OWASP ZAP (web app scanning).
Attack: Exploit vulnerabilities with Metasploit Framework.
Reporting: Use templates from "Pentest-Tools".
How to Learn: Practice the OWASP Web Security Testing Framework.
3. Security Standards & Compliance
Objective: Align with regulations using resources.
Explanation:
Standards: GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001.
How to Learn: Use the OWASP Top 10 to prioritize web vulnerabilities.
4. Risk Assessment Basics
Objective: Prioritize vulnerabilities with scoring systems.
Explanation:
CVSS Calculator: Use the NVD CVSS Calculator .
Risk Matrix: Categorize risks as High/Medium/Low using spreadsheets (Google Sheets/Excel).
5. Common Vulnerabilities
Objective: Identify flaws in labs/tools.
Explanation:
Network Vulnerabilities: Misconfigurations, open ports (use Nmap).
Web Vulnerabilities: SQLi, XSS (practice on OWASP Juice Shop).
How to Learn: Use labs to understand the practical approach:
Metasploitable (intentionally vulnerable VM).
VulnHub (vulnerable machines).
6. Documentation Fundamentals
Objective: Create reports with tools.
Explanation:
Tools:
Dradis CE (collaborative reporting).
CherryTree (note-taking for technical findings).
You can use anything standard reporting tool of your own too
How to Learn: Use free templates from GitHub.
Practical Application
1. Setup Testing Environment
Steps:
Install Kali Linux.
Download Metasploitable 3 (vulnerable VM) from GitHub.
Configure VirtualBox to host VMs.
2. Vulnerability Scanning
Tools:
OpenVAS (integrated in Kali Linux).
Nikto (web server scanner).
Steps:
Scan Metasploitable with OpenVAS:
sudo openvas-start  # Launch OpenVAS  
Analyze results (e.g., CVSS scores, CVE IDs).
3. Document Findings
Tools:
Spreadsheets (Google Sheets/Excel) for vulnerability tracking.
Screenshots
Steps:
Record:
IP addresses, ports, services.
Vulnerability descriptions (e.g., "Apache Tomcat outdated").
4. Practice Risk Assessment
Steps:
Use the CVSS Calculator to score vulnerabilities.
Prioritize risks using a 3x3 matrix (Likelihood vs. Impact).
5. Create Basic Reports
Summarize sources consulted for each topic and Submit a Comprehensive Report as PDF File
Structure your report:
Executive Summary: High-level risks.
Technical Details: Screenshots, CVSS scores.
Remediation: Patch links, configuration fixes.
