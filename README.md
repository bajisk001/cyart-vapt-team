This repository contains all tasks completed during my 4-week Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT) intern program. The labs were performed using Kali Linux, targeting intentionally vulnerable machines such as Metasploitable2, Mr. Robot, and HTB Lame, while following standard penetration testing methodologies.
Throughout the training, I actively learned and utilized a wide range of security tools including: Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nikto, Gobuster, Sublist3r, Dirsearch, Wappalyzer, Searchsploit, OpenVAS, Wireshark, FFUF, whois/WhatWeb, and cURL.
